Below is a brief description of the errors1. Spelling Errors Ð The dataset contained a number of spelling errors. To find the spelling errors, the text facet feature was used to find the errors and these errors were fixed by manual edit.2. Multiple representation Ð The data set contained data that had multiple representations of the same thing. The text facet was used to identify the errors, then the cluster and edit feature was used fix them. 3. Mixed columns Ð Some columns in the dataset were mixed up, displaying data from different columns in a column. This was resolved using the custom text transform feature under the edit cell feature.4. Redundant data Ð The unique project ID which is not so unique and the Project ID, which is unique, serve the same purpose, so the unique project ID column was deleted. 5. Duplicate record detection- some of the projects records were duplicated within the dataset. The cluster and edit feature was used to find this error. Once found the duplicated data was starred and then the stars rows are viewed later by applying the star facet feature to all columns, select true values and delete them by selecting the remove all matching rows form the edit rows menu.6. Summation records Ð Summation records were detected in the unique investment column. This was found while applying the text facet function to the columns of the dataset. To resolve this, I found all total rows and then starred them. To delete the rows, the facet by star from the All column was selected, then true was selected which then displayed all starred columns, finally, remove all matching rows form the edit row menu was applied to remove the columns.7. Wrong column titles Ð all the columns in the dataset had a wrong column name. The column names were represented as fields and not as titles. This was resolved by renaming reach column title to its appropriate nameAUDIENCE AND USE CASE FOR VISUALISATIONSVISUALISATION 1This visualisation shows information about the average cost and schedule variances for the projects different departments.
